# FIN3080 Assignment 5 README

## Introduction
Here is Yu Kangqi's Assignment 5 of FIN3080 in CUHKsz.

### Summary
The report decribes how I use the eps data to constuct an indicator called SUE, which is used to measure how well a firm have done last semi-annual.
Then, I use abnormal return (compare with market) to derive the abnormal cumulative return in an 241 days event window. Then, I find a universal drift down phenomenon in all portfolios, which is a strong envidence that the Chinese stock market is not semi-strong.

## Usage

### Requirements
To run the code of me smoothly. You need to install numpy, pandas, matplotlib seaborn first.

### Dos
There is three jupyter notebook files, one assignment and one report.\
